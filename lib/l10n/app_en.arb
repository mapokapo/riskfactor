Autism is thought to be related to a decrease in the number of certain brain neurotransmitters that require vitamin B6 to function normally. Heart disease is associated with low doses of vitamin B6 in the body. Numerous studies have reported that people with low levels of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (a form of vitamin B6) show a much higher risk of heart attack than people with higher levels.",

  "vitaminB12Content": "Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in foods such as fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk and dairy products. Its key role is to protect us from anemia, the main culprit for the feeling of fatigue and exhaustion, ie to provide the body with enough red blood cells that will successfully carry oxygen throughout the body. Vitamin B12 also promotes healthy nerve function, and some research has linked this vitamin to a lower risk of breast cancer, heart disease and infertility (especially men because it increases sperm count and motility). According to the recommendations of the American National Institutes of Health, 2.4 milligrams of vitamin B2 should be taken daily through food or supplements.\n\nVegans are also at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, as this vitamin is obtained exclusively from foods of animal origin. People with atrophic gastritis may also have a problem with the absorption of this vitamin. However, it should be emphasized that the human body has a large supply of this vitamin, so with insufficient intake through food, the deficit is felt only after a few years.\n\nOne of the typical symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency is fatigue. When the supply of vitamin B12 is low, the body cannot produce the red blood cells needed to supply the body with oxygen. The result is anemia, so the person feels unusually weak and weak. The problem is that fatigue as such is a very vague symptom, as it can be attributed to a number of other situations such as stress or lack of sleep.\n\nHowever, if the fatigue is constantly getting worse and you cannot find the cause, be sure to contact your doctor and check your blood count. From your brain, across your spine to your arms and legs, there is a long nervous system called the back tract, which is lined with the fatty white substance myelin. Myelin not only protects and insulates the nerves but also speeds up nerve impulses, allowing the hands and feet to feel the touch. Vitamin B12 is needed to produce myelin. Thus, when the amounts of this essential vitamin are depleted, myelin breaks down and nerve impulses cannot “travel” so fast, resulting in tingling in the arms and legs.\n\nPeople who are at potential risk of deficiency of this vitamin are advised, in addition to consuming foods containing it and supplements, to avoid excessive intake of foods that block the absorption of vitamin B12, such as soy, then drugs that reduce stomach acid, vitamin C, and some data say how the absorption of B 12 is disturbed and diabetes medications. The supply of vitamin B 12 is also depleted by smoking, so smokers (but also everyone else) are recommended to increase the amount of calcium.",

  "vitaminDContent": "Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults.\n\nThere are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections.\n\nSome studies suggest adequate vitamin D levels help when we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent.\n\nThe Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) says studies on using vitamin D for treating or preventing chest infections showed insufficient evidence to recommend it for this.",
